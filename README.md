Python Voice assistant

Python3 voice assistant understands difference between sudo commands and regular commands. 

Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/dankwaifu/voice-assisant
sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio ffmpeg
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

#to run
sudo python3 assistant.py
```

once you run it it will listen for a "Shift + Tab" and you can use one of two phrases
"hey bitch"
or "sudo bitch"

if you need the assistant to do something that requires sudo access you can use this. Maybe dont tell people this phrase.
